# Frequently Asked Questions ❓

Common architectural questions and rationale behind Solar's design decisions.

## 🌲 Architecture & Flake Structure

### Q: Why not keep modules in one flat directory?

A flat directory becomes unmaintainable as configurations scale past 5 machines. Solar’s dendritic tree creates a clear separation between:

- Foundations (`core/`)
- Platform tools (`programs/`, `platforms/`, `services/`)
- Workflow presets (`suites/`)
- Concrete machine declarations (`hosts/`)

### Q: How does automatic module discovery work?

`modules/default.nix` recursively scans `modules/` for `.nix` files and automatically maps them to typed options under `myFeatures.<path>.enable`. You never have to manually import new feature files in `flake.nix`.

## 💾 Storage & Ephemeral Roots

### Q: What is "wipe-on-boot" (ephemeral root)?

On hosts like **`mars`**, **`mercury`**, and the **Pluto Cluster**, the root filesystem (`/`) is mounted in RAM (`tmpfs`) or wiped on every boot. Only directories explicitly declared in `preservation` (such as `.config`, `.local/share`, `/etc/nixos`, and `/var/log`) survive reboots on the NVMe `/persist` subvolume. This prevents filesystem rot, stale cache buildup, and accidental unmanaged state.

### Q: How do I preserve a new application's state on an ephemeral host?

Declare it in the module's `preservation.preserveAt` list, or place the directory under `/persist/home/apollo/` and symlink it to your home folder.

## 🍏 macOS Darwin Integration

### Q: How does Solar manage both NixOS and macOS in the same flake?

`flake.nix` exports both `nixosConfigurations` (for Linux hosts) and `darwinConfigurations` (for macOS hosts like **`phobos`**). The module autoscanner (`modules/default.nix`) uses platform reflection to load `modules/darwin/` and modules with `isDarwin` or `isTotal` on macOS while excluding Linux-only kernel and driver modules.

## 🪐 The Fleet & Pluto Cluster

### Q: Why run K3s as an HA cluster on mini-PCs and laptops?

The Pluto Cluster provides a resilient, zero-single-point-of-failure GitOps platform for self-hosted services (Jellyfin, Home Assistant, Minecraft). By using three heterogeneous physical nodes with an embedded etcd quorum, individual nodes can reboot for system updates without service downtime.

### Q: Why are Ganymede and Callisto deprecated?

Legacy storage nodes `ganymede` and `callisto` were retired in favor of **`sol`** (Central ZFS NAS with multi-terabyte mirrored storage and NFS exports) and dynamic Kubernetes persistent volumes managed by the Pluto Cluster.

### Q: Why is LUKS encryption not enabled on the servers and Pluto nodes by default?

Workstations and laptops (`mars`, `mercury`) have `enableLuks = true` because they are personal or portable devices with a high risk of theft or loss.

On headless servers and cluster nodes (`pluto`, `styx`, `hydra`, `sol`), LUKS is disabled by default for operational availability:

1. **Unattended Automated Reboots**: Pluto nodes perform staggered rolling weekly maintenance reboots (Sunday 03:00, 03:30, 04:00 UTC) to apply updates while maintaining the 2/3 etcd quorum. A manual passphrase prompt blocks early boot (`initrd`), keeping the node offline after unexpected power cuts or kernel updates.
1. **Ephemeral In-Memory Root (`tmpfs`)**: Cluster nodes boot into RAM (`/` on `tmpfs`). No application secrets or root filesystem state reside on the local disk.
1. **Encrypted Secrets at Rest**: Agenix secrets (`*.age`) are encrypted using asymmetric Age keys and decrypted directly into RAM (`/run/agenix/`) on boot.

*Note: For environments requiring physical disk encryption on stationary nodes, ThinkCentre M920q/M720q nodes support sealing LUKS keys to their discrete **TPM 2.0 (PCR 0+7)** using `systemd-cryptenroll`, enabling tamper-proof automated unlocking without human intervention.*
